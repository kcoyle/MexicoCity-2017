#Creating the Catalog, Before and After FRBR

##Introduction

There is a great deal of talk today about the future of the library catalog. 
There is also ongoing work on developing a "next generation" library bibliographic data format, 
possibly based on the model presented by the IFLA study group on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records.  
There is a tendency, however, to treat the current state of data and catalogs as a starting point. 
The historical context is, however, much richer.

The history that we need to confront is long and complex. 
In terms of technology, you can date library catalogs back to the times of clay tablets and to tags 
affixed to the ends of scrolls in Greek and Roman times. 
Technological progress led to the use of book catalogs, paper slips, and eventually cards. 
In modern times the catalog technology moved from physical cards to a virtual catalog on computer and managed by a database system. 
In progress today is a transition from closed database systems to the use of the Web of data and the World Wide Web Consortium's 
Resource Description Framework (RDF) . 
 
We also need to consider how information itself has changed over time, from the first written symbols to virtual reality. 
And finally there is the lengthy history of libraries and their functions over the milennia of reccorded history.

Libraries have been innovators or organizational technology, although they shared their innovation with other professions with similar needs.
The move from book catalogs to cards in the late 19th century coincided with a move from ledger books to office filing systems within business ventures of the same time period.[Krajewski]
If we look, however, at the time line of information technology over the 20th century and into the 21st, we see library technology falling behind the general technology evolution.

Libraries moved to automated printing of cards in the very early days of computer technology, made possible by the development of an innovative record format for the card data, MAchine Readable Cataloging (MARC), in the mid-1960's. Not long after that, around 1980, that data was used for the first time to create library catalogs online, accessible first at terminals in the library and eventually from any networked point. Since that time library catalogs have gained features, such as federated searching of library holdings and journal article metadata. Yet the main technology remains the same, rooted in techniques from three or more decades past.
